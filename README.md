This first part of the project will be related to a chat application.

I will not detail the code yet, it's not ready for production and probably i will be changing a lot of things, because the first chat application didn't work well on google hosting environment and i have to find another one for replace.

An application with long-living connection provide by websocket i could find a good place to host a backend, so if i can't find i'll probably gonna use firestore or RTDM instead websocket
